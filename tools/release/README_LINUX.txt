GTA V Xbox 360 recompilation - Linux
=====================================

This package contains no game. It holds a launcher, an Xbox 360 runtime and the tools that turn
your own copy of Grand Theft Auto V for Xbox 360 into a native Linux build on your computer.
No Rockstar Games or Microsoft game code, data, shaders or title-update files are included.

Do not share what you build
---------------------------
Everything this package makes from your discs is Rockstar Games' copyrighted work: the game
folder (data/), the recompiled game library (gtav_game.*), the generated C++, the translated
shaders (data/spirv, shader_cache), and the GTAV.ipa and Android pack made by "Build for iPhone"
and "Build for Android". They are for your own devices only. Never upload, share or link them,
and never add them to a fork or a release. The GPL license of this project covers its own code
only; it gives no one the right to share Rockstar's. Rules for forks and downstream releases:
https://github.com/andrewnakas/gtav-recomp#keeping-it-clean-rules-for-forks-and-downstream-releases

What you need
-------------
- Your own Xbox 360 discs of GTA V: Disc 1 (Install) and Disc 2 (Play), as ISO images or as
  extracted folders.
- Title Update 27 for GTA V from your own console: the TU file (tu00000009_00000000) or a folder
  with disc002/default.xexp and disc002/update.rpf.
- 64-bit Linux with glibc 2.35 and GCC 13's libstdc++ (GLIBCXX_3.4.32) or newer: Ubuntu 24.04,
  Debian 13, Fedora 39, Arch, openSUSE Tumbleweed or newer. (Ubuntu 22.04 works after installing
  libstdc++6 from the ubuntu-toolchain-r/test PPA; Debian 12 is too old.)
- A CPU with AVX2 (Intel Haswell / AMD Zen or newer), a GPU with current Vulkan drivers and the
  Vulkan loader (libvulkan.so.1; on Ubuntu/Debian: libvulkan1 and mesa-vulkan-drivers, or the
  NVIDIA driver). A desktop session (X11 or Wayland): the X11/xcb and Wayland client libraries,
  zlib and zstd that every desktop system has.
- A controller (Xbox-style, through SDL).
- About 25 GB free on this drive during setup (about 17 GB once installed), 8 GB RAM or more.
  Put the package on a Linux filesystem (ext4, btrfs, xfs) or exFAT; it needs executable files.

First run
---------
1. Unpack the archive somewhere with enough space:
     tar xf gtav-recomp-linux-x64.tar.gz
     cd gtav-recomp-linux-x64
2. Open gtav_launcher: double-click it in your file manager (GNOME Files: right-click it, "Run as
   a Program"), or run ./gtav_launcher in a terminal. The setup window opens: choose Disc 1,
   Disc 2 and the title update (each an image/file or an extracted folder), then press Install.
   Without a desktop (or with --cli) the same setup runs in the terminal instead, and
     ./gtav_launcher --setup "/path/Disc 1.iso" "/path/Disc 2.iso" /path/tu00000009_00000000
   runs it with the paths given.
3. The launcher checks every file against known-good hashes, copies them into data/, generates C++
   from your game executable, compiles it into gtav_game.so with the bundled clang and removes the
   build files. This takes 15-30 minutes depending on your CPU. Cancel (or Ctrl+C in the terminal)
   stops it; running setup again continues where it stopped.
4. Press Play. The first minutes of play translate shaders in the background; some objects can be
   missing until their shader is ready. They are kept in data/spirv for later runs. Setup also adds
   "GTA V recomp" to your applications menu.

Later runs: the menu entry or ./gtav_launcher starts the game directly. ./gtav_launcher --setup
(or the menu entry's "Run setup again") opens the setup window again, for example after moving
your discs.

Game options go after "--". On a laptop with two GPUs, pick the dedicated one with
  ./gtav_launcher -- --vulkan_device=1
Esc in game opens the settings menu (quality presets, frame rate limit, VSync, FPS counter).
The game log is data/logs/gtav.log, the setup log data/logs/install.log.

iPhone (experimental)
---------------------
Play GTA V on an iPhone 12 or newer (iOS 17+). The phone cannot build the game itself, so this
PC does it once (about 15 minutes); the phone then installs the game files from your discs.
1. Set up and play the game here for a while first (the phone gets the shaders the PC has seen:
   drive around, go indoors).
2. Press "Build for iPhone" in the setup window (or run ./gtav_launcher --iphone). When it is
   done, iphone/GTAV.ipa is next to it.
3. Install GTAV.ipa with a sideloading tool that runs on Linux (for example AltServer-Linux with
   AltStore), or copy it to a Windows PC or Mac with Sideloadly. A free Apple ID re-signs every
   7 days.
4. Put your Disc 1 ISO, Disc 2 ISO and the TU file on a USB stick and plug it into the phone (or
   copy them into GTA V's folder in the phone's Files app).
5. Open GTA V on the phone and press Install. It copies and checks about 16 GB, then starts.
Objects missing on the phone? Copy the phone's GTA V > shader_cache folder to iphone/shader_cache
here, run --iphone again (a few minutes) and reinstall GTAV.ipa; the game files stay.

Android (experimental)
----------------------
Play GTA V on an Android phone with a recent Snapdragon (tested: Galaxy S23 FE, Snapdragon 8 Gen 1)
and about 40 GB free during setup. The app has no game in it: this PC builds your game code for
the phone once (about 15-30 minutes), and the phone installs the game files from your discs.
1. Set up and play the game here for a while first (the phone gets the shaders the PC has seen:
   drive around, go indoors).
2. Press "Build for Android" in the setup window (or run ./gtav_launcher --android). When it is
   done, android/gtav-android-pack.zip is next to it.
3. Install android/GTAV.apk on the phone (copy it over and open it; allow installing apps from
   that source).
4. Copy gtav-android-pack.zip, your Disc 1 ISO, Disc 2 ISO and the TU file to the phone (for
   example its Download folder).
5. Open GTA V on the phone, choose the four files and press Install. It copies and checks about
   16 GB, then starts the game. Keep the app open while it installs. The disc images and the pack
   can be deleted afterwards.
Objects missing on the phone? Copy the phone's Android/data/com.gtavrecomp.app/files/shader_cache
folder to android/shader_cache here, press "Build for Android" again (a few minutes) and choose the
new pack on the phone (long-press the app icon, "Run setup again"); the game files stay. A newer GTAV.apk needs a new pack (the app says so).
Known issues on Android: some cutscenes in the prologue play without their centre channel (lines
of dialogue are missing); about 20-28 fps, lower once the phone gets hot; the touch controls are
basic (a controller works better).

Everything made from your files stays in this folder (data/, gtav_game.so, iphone/GTAV.ipa and
android/gtav-android-pack.zip). Do not share any of it: it contains Rockstar Games' copyrighted
work. (android/GTAV.apk as downloaded holds no game and is fine to share.)

Bundled tools: clang and lld from LLVM 19.1.5 (official release build, Apache-2.0 with LLVM
exception), DirectX Shader Compiler (NCSA). tools/llvm/lib/libxml2.so.2 is not libxml2: it is a
small stand-in from this project (tools/release/lld_libxml2_stub.c) so lld starts on systems
without libxml2; the ELF linking the launcher does never uses it.
